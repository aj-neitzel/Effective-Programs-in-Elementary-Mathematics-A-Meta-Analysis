## Abstract
This article reviews research on the achievement outcomes of elementary mathematics programs. 85 rigorous experimental studies evaluated 64 programs in grades K-5. The studies were very high in quality, with 72 (85%) randomized and 13 (15%) quasi-experimental evaluations. Programs were organized in 6 categories. Particularly positive outcomes were found for tutoring programs. One-to-one and one-to-small group tutoring models had similar impacts, as did teachers and teaching assistants as tutors. Positive outcomes were seen in studies focused on professional development for cooperative learning, classroom management, and metacognitive skills. Professional development approaches focused on helping teachers gain in understanding of mathematics content and pedagogy had little impact on student achievement. Professional development intended to help in the adoption of new curricula had a small but significant impact for traditional curricula, but not for digital curricula. Traditional and digital curricula with limited professional development and benchmark assessment programs found few positive effects. 

## What's Included Here
This folder includes the dataset and program files analyzed for this paper.  These data were collected by the research team from studies included in a systematic review of programs for elementary mathematics.  The data contain study and finding level information.  All data needed for replication can be found in *public_use_dataset_Studies.csv* and *public_use_dataset_Findings.csv*.

The R script *ElementaryMath_ICPSR.R* can be used to replicate the analyses and generate the Tables in the paper.  The tables will be saved in a single Microsoft Word file.
